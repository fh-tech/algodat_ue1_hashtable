/** \brief A hashtable for saving Share data.
 *
 * A hashtable implementation using quadratic probing for collision avoidance.
 * The main data structure consists of two std::vector, where each contains a list of buckets.
 * A bucket is a simple struct, which holds both a pointer into the other table and a pointer to the actual element.
 *
 * This hashtable uses quadratic probing in case of a hash collision and provides an easy c++-iterator interface to generate
 * a sequence of Buckets for a specific hash.
 *
 * This table supports inserting, removing, and searching Share objects. The search and delete is implemented to support searching
 * and deleting via two different keys.
 *
 * On delete a bucket is not removed, but set invalid. An invalid bucket is ignored when searching and overwritten when inserting.
 * To combat performance degradation, when a lot of elements are inserted and then removed, during a search the first invalid
 * element is marked and once the searched for element is found the table overwrites the invalid with the found element.
 *
